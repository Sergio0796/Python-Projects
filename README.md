Maze Solver and Block Puzzle use artificial intelligence concepts to be able to accept and solve a maze or 8-block puzzle. 
The Maze Solver uses the concept of Breadth-First Search (BFS), an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. 
It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. The Block Puzzle Solver uses A*, 
A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: 
starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost.
It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.
